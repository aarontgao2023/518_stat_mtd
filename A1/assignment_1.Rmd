## Question 1 
A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain-free. Results are summarized in the contingency table below.
\begin{tabular}{clccc} 
& & \multicolumn{2}{c}{ Pain free } & \\
\cline { 2 - 4 } & & Yes & No & Total \\
\cline { 2 - 4 } Group & Treatment & 10 & 33 & 43 \\
& Control & 2 & 44 & 46 \\
\cline { 2 - 5 } & Total & 12 & 77 & 89
\end{tabular}
(a) What percent of patients in the treatment group were pain-free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture?
(b) What percent were pain-free in the control group?
(c) In which group did a higher percentage of patients become pain-free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture?
(d) Your findings so far might suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines for all people who suffer from migraines. However, this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients that are pain-free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture in the two groups?

## Question 2 
The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These patients were randomly split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on the quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant.

(a) Identify the main research question of the study. 
(b) Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included? 
(c) What are the variables in the study? Identify each variable as numerical or categorical. If numerical, state whether the variable is discrete or continuous. If categorical, state whether the variable is ordinal. 
  
## Question 3 
Researchers hypothesized that a particular taste receptor in hummingbirds, T1R1-T1R3, played a primary role in dictating taste behavior; specifically, in determining which compounds hummingbirds detect as sweet. In a series of field tests, hummingbirds were presented simultaneously with two filled containers, one containing test stimuli and a second containing sucrose. The test stimuli included aspartame, erythritol, water, and sucrose. Aspartame is an artificial sweetener that tastes sweet to humans but is not detected by hummingbird T1R1-T1R3, while erythritol is an artificial sweetener known to activate T1R1-T1R3. Data were collected on how long a hummingbird drank from a particular container for a given trial, measured in seconds. For example, in one field test comparing aspartame and sucrose, a hummingbird drank from the aspartame container for 0.54 seconds and from the sucrose container for 3.21 seconds.

(a) Which tests are controls? Which tests are treatments? 
(b) Identify the response variable(s) in the study. Are they numerical or categorical?
(c) Describe the main research question.
  
## Question 4 
Echinacea has been widely used as an herbal remedy for the common cold, but previous studies evaluating its efficacy as a remedy has produced conflicting results. In a new study, researchers randomly assigned 437 volunteers to receive either a placebo or echinacea treatment before being infected with rhinovirus. Healthy young adult volunteers were recruited for the study from the University of Virginia community.

(a) Identify the population of interest and the sample in this study. 
(b) Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be generalized to a larger population. 
(c) Can the findings of the study be used to establish causal relationships? Justify your answer. 

## Question 5 
In order to assess the effectiveness of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university. A quarter of the patients were randomly assigned a placebo, and the rest were randomly allocated between 1g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at the onset of a cold for the following two days. All tablets had identical appearance and packaging. No significant differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four medication groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of symptoms. 

(a) Was this an experiment or an observational study? Why? 
(b) What are the explanatory and response variables in this study? 
(c) Participants are ultimately able to choose whether or not to use the pills prescribed to them. We might expect that not all of them will adhere to and take their pills. Does this introduce a confounding variable to the study? Explain your reasoning. 

## Question 6 
A researcher is interested in the effects of exercise on mental health and he proposes the following study: Use stratified random sampling to recruit 18-30, 31-40, and 41-55-year-olds from the population. Next, randomly assign half the subjects from each age group to exercise twice a week, and instruct the rest not to exercise. Conduct a mental health exam at the beginning and at the end of the study, and compare the results.

(a) What type of study is this? 
(b) What are the treatment and control groups in this study? 
(c) Does this study make use of blocking? If so, what is the blocking variable? 
(d) Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be used to establish a causal relationship between exercise and mental health, and indicate whether or not the conclusions can be generalized to the population at large. 
(e) Suppose you are given the task of determining if this proposed study should get funding. Would you have any reservations about the study proposal? 

## Question 7 
For each part, compare distributions (1) and (2) based on their means and standard deviations. You do not need to calculate these statistics; simply state how the means and the standard deviations compare. Make sure to explain your reasoning. Hint: It may be useful to sketch dot plots of the distributions.

(a) (1) 3, 5, 5, 5, 8, 11, 11, 11, 13
    (2) 3, 5, 5, 5, 8, 11, 11, 11, 20
(b) (1) -20, 0, 0, 0, 15, 25, 30, 30
    (2) -40, 0, 0, 0, 15, 25, 30, 30
(c) (1) 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
    (2) 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30
(d) (1) 100, 200, 300, 400, 500
    (2) 0, 50, 300, 550, 600

## Question 8 
Daily air quality is measured by the air quality index (AQI) reported by the Environmental Protection Agency. This index reports the pollution level and what associated health effects might be a concern. The index is calculated for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act and takes values from 0 to 300, where a higher value indicates lower air quality. AQI was reported for a sample of 91 days in 2011 in Durham, NC. The relative frequency histogram below shows the distribution of the AQI values on these days. 
![](daily_aqi.png)

(a) Based on the histogram, describe the distribution of daily AQI. 
(b) Estimate the median AQI value of this sample. 
(c) Would you expect the mean AQI value of this sample to be higher or lower than the median? Explain your reasoning. 

## Question 9 
910 randomly sampled registered voters from Tampa, FL were asked if they thought workers who have illegally entered the US should be (i) allowed to keep their jobs and apply for US citizenship, (ii) allowed to keep their jobs as temporary guests workers but not allowed to apply for US citizenship, or (iii) lose their jobs and have to leave the country. The results of the survey by political ideology are shown below.
\begin{tabular}{llcccc} 
& & \multicolumn{3}{c}{ Political ideology } & \\
\cline { 2 - 5 } & & Conservative & Moderate & Liberal & Total \\
\cline { 2 - 5 } Response & (i) Apply for citizenship & 57 & 120 & 101 & 278 \\
& (ii) Guest worker & 121 & 113 & 28 & 262 \\
& (iii) Leave the country & 179 & 126 & 45 & 350 \\
& (iv) Not sure & 15 & 4 & 1 & 20 \\
\cline { 2 - 5 } & Total & 372 & 363 & 175 & 910
\end{tabular}
(a) What percent of these Tampa, FL voters identify themselves as conservatives? 
(b) What percent of these Tampa, FL voters are in favor of the citizenship option? 
(c) What percent of these Tampa, FL voters identify themselves as conservatives and are in favor of the citizenship option? 
(d) What percent of these Tampa, FL voters who identify themselves as conservatives are also in favor of the citizenship option? What percent of moderates share this view? What percent of liberals share this view? 

## Question 10 
![](association.png)
